# Sorting Layer Character Manager for Unity 2D (v2020.02.06.0)

It's a simple asset, it lets you manage the layers belonging to parts of a 2D character. That is, it is a Sorting Layers manager for 2D characters. I realized that this would make it easier for me to work with the "Anima2D" asset, having to clean up layer by layer of a character wasted a lot of time, so I ended up making this tool simple and useful. I will update the pertinent information to this asset over time, I hope I have helped.
